# misc-bash-scripts
A collection of bash scripts that I have written for one-off applications. Feel to use any of them however you want, but I must warn you that they probably aren't the best examples to learn from. I generally try to stay somewhat portable and POSIX compliant but I also don't follow a lot of best practices.
