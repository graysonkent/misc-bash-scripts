# misc-bash-scripts
A collection of bash scripts that I have written for one-off applications. Feel to use any of them however you want, but I must warn you that they probably aren't the best examples to learn from. I generally try to stay somewhat portable and POSIX compliant but I also don't follow a lot of best practices.

# Documentation
I try to comment on any unusual or non-obvious parts of my code, but you can also find more explanations on my website: https://www.graysonskent.com or just email me about it.
