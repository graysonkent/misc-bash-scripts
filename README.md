A collection of scripts that I have written for one-off applications. Feel to use any of them however you want. I generally try to stay somewhat portable and POSIX compliant.

# Running the scripts
I test these on GNU bash(Version 4.2.25(1)-release x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) and a Debian Stable machine(3.16.0-4-amd64 right now). I don't guarantee these will work on any UNIX platform and there may be edge cases that I didn't account for.

# Documentation
I try to comment on any unusual or non-obvious parts of my code, but you can also find more explanations on my website: www.grayson.sh or just email me about it.

# License
Do whatever you want with them, just don't blame me.
