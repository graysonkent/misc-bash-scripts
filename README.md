# misc-bash-scripts
A collection of bash scripts that I have written for one-off applications. Feel to use any of them however you want, but I must warn you that they probably aren't the best examples to learn from. I generally try to stay somewhat portable and POSIX compliant but I also don't follow a lot of best practices.

# Running the scripts
I test these on GNU bash(Version 4.2.25(1)-release x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) and a Debian Stable machine(3.16.0-4-amd64 right now). I don't guarantee these will work on any UNIX platform and there may be edge cases that I didn't account for.

# Why no commit history?
I have had people ask in the past why I push final bash scripts with no commit history and it is usually just because of my coding style. I commit so often and I don't want to clog up this repo with the 1000 things I tried that didn't work and confuse people.

# Documentation
I try to comment on any unusual or non-obvious parts of my code, but you can also find more explanations on my website: https://www.graysonskent.com or just email me about it.
